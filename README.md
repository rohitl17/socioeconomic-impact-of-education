# Project Description

Good data visualizations have good data, the right choice for visualization, the color or information are simple and explicit, the data are accurately represented, and there is consistency in scales [1]. With these principles in mind, we work with the World Development Indicators dataset from the World Bank [2]. It has  time-series data for a majority of the worldâ€™s countries from 1960-2020. These development indicators together belong to either Health, Policies, Education, or other categories. The dataset in total has 383838 data points and 65 columns. The file size is 195 MB.  As stated in the assignment description, we start by iteratively framing and reframing our hypothesis. Here,  we correlate education with socio-economic status, health, and family decision-making of women in  Senegal throughout 2000-2019. We end up drawing a visualization dashboard with a set of multivariate visualization in a grid that justifies the hypothesis. The tools used for this assignment are Microsoft Excel, 
Python, and Tableau primarily.


# Conclusion
The activity started by looking at the whole data initially. The overall process looked quite unintuitive to proceed. Some of the initial EDA helped in narrowing down to a hypothesis. Multiple iterations of plotting, refining helped define a specific hypothesis with some limitations which worked out well on the dashboard.  The final visualization was plotted keeping in mind all the visualization principles learned in class. In the end, with all the data and visualizations, we can conclude that the positive correlation between primary completion rate and socio-economic status and health of Senegalese women for 2000-2019 is strong. The visualization dashboard can further be improved by adding interactivity to it.
